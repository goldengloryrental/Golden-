GOLDEN GLORY RENTAL
Hey brides, bridesmaids, and those who love to wear jewelry! We are here to give color to your dream and make your big day memorable.
Every bride wants to look gorgeous on her big day. Apart from the wedding dress, bridal jewelry also plays a major part in her wedding look. Since a wedding is a one-day affair, most of the brides don't want to spend more money on buying expensive jewelry just for a single day.
If you are such a bride and are searching for an alternative, we are here for you!
As we all know, jewelry is a person's best friend if they have excellent taste, aesthetic sense, and a passion for flamboyance. It has played a crucial role in advancing the social and security standing of any family while enhancing the wearer's beauty with much-needed grandeur. A bride would include the essentials that would enable her to start a new life in her new house in any bridal trousseau. It would include her most fashionable clothing, a dhurrie that she made by hand, and of course, ornaments that will serve as the cornerstone of her new beginning.
But as knowledge has grown, there has been a dynamic shift in recent times. Individuals are beginning to recognise the detrimental effects of the jewelry-making industry, and with the introduction of virtual currency, they are also realizing that it is not the ideal investment. The wisdom that the health of the world comes before our opulence in self-decoration is finally beginning to dawn. People are also more adventurous than ever due to the always evolving world of fashion and style, particularly in this Instagrammable era when attention spans have decreased and things change with every scroll.
The renting manner of dressing has emerged as a result of this. Not that renting was never an option; in fact, the rental lifestyle is growing more and more extravagant, encompassing everything from clothing to furnishings to homes. You heard correctly—people are now amenable to renting jewelry or clothing!
For the past few years, the rental market has been booming, particularly in the jewelry industry. Wearing the family jewels that their ancestors left behind doesn't actually matter to brides. These days, it's all about accessorizing the ideal ensemble with the finest jewelry, whether it be rented or purchased. Not that the heritage gems aren't significant—of course they are, as they help you connect to your past and ancestry—but not exactly on your wedding day. On a wedding day, the bride and her splendor are everything!
There are numerous additional reasons why renting is preferable to buying, or at the very least, why it merits consideration:
Economic Reasons: If you don't like bulky sets, investing in a Rs 75,000 Kundan set for your wedding might not be the best use of your money. In actuality, renting these will only set you back about $8,000 for four days, with the remaining funds being available for other excursions. Any purchase has an opportunity cost, and renting can help you completely avoid that expense!
Practical Reasons: It's a fact that none of us enjoy wearing jewelry on a daily basis. In actuality, jewelry is more of an investment for Indians, and purchasing gold is considered lucky. Although investments yield high returns, they may not be prudent for the fashion industry. Once you purchase a set of jewelry, it won't go with every outfit or be something you want to wear frequently. In this scenario, renting turns out to be the best option. You select the most elegant or statement pieces from our collection, without having to commit. Think of it as a fling!
Sustainable Lifestyle: Renting a home is unquestionably a more sustainable option. Renting prolongs a product's life, which slows it down. The majority of the brands engage in mass production and are fast fashion companies. Every high-end handbag company burns its unsold inventory. The rental lifestyle will result in decreased demand as well as a longer product life, which will slow down the product. Renting a home allows you to live a luxurious lifestyle without endangering the environment.
Try: Trying new things is wonderful, but it has a price, particularly when it comes to accessories—and not just any old accessories, but expensive ones. You can decide not to wear the jewelry you purchase the following year, or it might become outdated. The greatest way to experiment with style without going broke is to rent accessories.
Purchasing Requires Commitment: Purchasing requires a significant financial and practical commitment, particularly when jewelry is involved. Most of the time, we foolishly overspend in the name of retail therapy and later come to regret it. When you rent jewelry, there are no obligations—you just use it, style it, and return it. 
Even while rental jewellery is really popular right now, the market isn't particularly structured. There are several artificial jewellery rental businesses in every city and town, and wedding season is when business is at its highest. A woman must reserve the jewelry far in advance if she truly wants to capture and realize her ideal wedding look, as there are only so many stores and so many weddings. It's important to prepare ahead because the best items tend to sell out quickly. Another inconvenience for the bride and her family is having to pick up the jewelry on the wedding day and return it the very next morning with such offline businesses..
Online rental stores have recently emerged to support these factors. They make it simple to reserve jewellery from the convenience of one's own home. These cutting-edge start-ups are also offering the luxury of time by renting out these exquisite diamonds for at least four days at a comparable cost. Anything from American diamonds to polki to kundan can be found here that one loves! You can easily hire designer jewels that match and enhance your wedding attire, even without having to go shopping in the sweltering heat!
Jewellery rentals are here to stay, and with the availability of online rental options like rent n flaunt, getting luxury jewellery for your special day is only going to grow easier! Above all, renting or a similar alternative lifestyle of consumption should be investigated; it is an urgent necessity. One of the most polluting businesses is the fashion one, and it is our collective duty to mitigate the effects. Renting a home also trains your intellect, which improves your decision-making in many areas of life, including fashion!
